Use markdown to add content.

1. Duplicate this directory within the `pages` directory
2. Rename the new page's directory to whatever you want the page to be. No space, all lowercase. Use dashes (-) in place of spaces.
3. Add an entry in `data/pages.csv` for this new page. The *page* value should be the same as the name of the new page's directory.
